## Our mission
USWDS is a design system for the federal government. We make it easier to build accessible, mobile-friendly government websites for the American public.

## History
USWDS was created by a collaborative team at 18F and the U.S. Digital Service in 2015, under the guidance of an advisory board of talented, experienced government workers in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Food and Drug Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, Social Security Administration, Department of Education, Internal Revenue Service, and GSA.

It is currently a project of GSA’s Technology Transformation Services, maintained by the Office of Solutions. Read about the initial process as well as where we’ve been and where we’re going.
